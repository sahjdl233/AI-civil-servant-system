The system features enhanced AI integration with reasoning model support, improved question type recognition, and intelligent content filtering for optimal user experience.

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwindcss v4
- **Backend**: FastAPI with Python 3.10+, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic
- **AI Integration**: Enhanced OpenAI integration with support for reasoning models and robust fallback mechanisms
- **Architecture**: Microservices with containerized deployment using Docker

## Development Commands

### 🚀 Quick Start (Recommended)

#### Full Stack Development (One Command)
```powershell
# Start both frontend and backend with dynamic port allocation
.\dev-fullstack.ps1

# Features:
# - Automatic port conflict resolution
# - Real-time service status monitoring  
# - Displays actual service URLs
# - Safe shutdown with Ctrl+C
# - Won't interfere with other applications

# Fixed Port Development (with reuse functionality)

### Recent Enhancements (Latest Update)

#### AI Service Improvements
- **Reasoning Model Support**: Enhanced `ai_service.py` to handle reasoning models (e.g., `openai/gpt-oss-120b`) that store responses in `reasoning_content` field
- **Question Type Recognition**: Fixed operator precedence bug and improved heuristic logic for accurate question type identification
- **Content Filtering**: Implemented intelligent prompt instruction filtering to ensure clean, user-friendly interface without internal AI prompts
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Added robust error handling with heuristic fallbacks when AI services fail

- CORS is configured to dynamically allow frontend origins based on port files
- Global exception handling provides detailed error information in Chinese
- Project includes Chinese documentation in markdown files
- Frontend uses custom `start-server.js` for dynamic port allocation
- Backend supports both traditional and progressive (streaming) essay grading

### AI Service Implementation Details

#### Question Type Recognition (`ai_service.py`)
- **Dual Recognition**: Combines AI-based recognition with heuristic fallback for reliability
- **Operator Precedence Fix**: Corrected logic bug that caused comprehensive analysis questions to be misidentified as summary questions
- **Enhanced Keywords**: Expanded keyword detection for comprehensive analysis questions (分析, 理解, 谈谈, 评价, 说明, 如何, 为什么, 关系, 作用, 意义, 影响, 原因)
- **Multi-layer Requirements**: Detects complex question patterns requiring both explanation and analysis

#### Reasoning Model Support
- **Content Field Handling**: Processes both `content` and `reasoning_content` response fields
- **Token Management**: Increased limits to accommodate reasoning model response patterns
- **Answer Extraction**: Implements `extract_answer_from_reasoning()` for parsing reasoning model outputs
- **Fallback Logic**: Graceful degradation when reasoning models return empty content fields

#### Content Filtering System
- **Prompt Leakage Prevention**: Removes internal AI instructions from user-facing content using regex patterns
- **Multiple Pattern Detection**: Handles various forms of prompt instruction leakage
- **User-friendly Output**: Ensures clean, professional interface without exposing AI internal prompts
- **Suggestion Optimization**: Replaces generic suggestions with specific, actionable feedback when available

### Development Workflow

#### 🌟 Recommended: One-Click Full Stack Development

   - Automatically starts backend (with venv, deps, DB, migrations)
   - Automatically starts frontend with turbopack
   - Finds free ports if defaults are occupied
   - Displays actual service URLs when ready
   - Monitors service health continuously

2. **Fixed Port Development**: Run `D:\some\run-dev-rare-ports.ps1`
   - Uses rare ports (backend: 65123, frontend: 65124) to avoid conflicts
   - Intelligently reuses existing services if ports are occupied
   - No "port already in use" errors - automatically detects and reuses running instances
   - Custom port support: `-BackendPort 8004 -FrontendPort 3000`
   - Skip database: `-NoDB`
   - Perfect for multiple development sessions without port conflicts

#### Alternative: Individual Service Management  
1. **Backend**: Use `.\dev.ps1` in `backend/` directory for complete auto-setup
   - Automatically creates Python virtual environment
   - Installs all dependencies
   - Starts PostgreSQL via Docker Compose
   - Applies database migrations
   - Starts FastAPI server with hot reload on available port
2. **Frontend**: Use `npm run dev` in `frontend/` directory for Next.js development
   - Automatically finds available port starting from 3000
   - Updates API configuration to match backend port
3. **Database**: Managed automatically by backend dev script or manually via `docker-compose up -d db`

#### 🛠️ Development Operations
- **Status Check**: `quick-restart.bat status` - See all running services
- **Quick Restart**: `quick-restart.bat restart` - Restart both services  
- **Safe Shutdown**: `quick-restart.bat safe-stop` - Stop with confirmation
- **Port Conflicts**: All scripts automatically handle port conflicts

### Testing
- Backend tests can be run with `pytest` from the `backend/` directory
- Use `pytest -v` for verbose test output
- Run specific tests with `pytest tests/test_filename.py`
- Multiple test files exist for various components and integration testing

### Utility Tools
- `tools/safe_cleanup.py` - Safely move unwanted files to .trash folder based on cleanup_candidates.txt
- `tools/restore_from_trash.py` - Restore files from .trash folder  
- Backend generates log files: `backend.log`, `backend_debug.log`, `backend_final.log`, etc.
- `quick-restart.bat` - Quick service management (start/stop/restart/status)

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
